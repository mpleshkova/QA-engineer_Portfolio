> 🚀 **Bonus project:** I’ve created a [Culinary Blog](https://github.com/mpleshkova/My_hobbies_blog?tab=readme-ov-file) using real products from [Rohlik.cz](https://www.rohlik.cz/en-CZ).  
> It combines my testing skills with real user experience — including recipes based on products available on the platform.

  <summary>🍽️ More about the blog</summary>
  <p>
    As a personal project, I maintain a small <a href="https://github.com/mpleshkova/my-hobbies-blog">blog</a> where I share my favorite recipes, coffee brewing notes, and travel reflections.  
    The <strong>Culinary Blog</strong> includes meals prepared using ingredients ordered from <a href="https://www.rohlik.cz/en-CZ">Rohlik.cz</a>, which I also use as a case study in this QA portfolio.  
    This cross-over helps me explore realistic user journeys from both customer and tester perspectives.
