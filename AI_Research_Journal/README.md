# 🔬 AI_Research_Journal

This section of my portfolio is dedicated to independent research and deep explorations  
of topics that I find critical and inspiring for a modern QA professional.

I invest time here to go beyond day-to-day QA work and explore adjacent areas,  
emerging technologies, and forward-thinking methodologies.

## Topics Covered

- **AI in Testing** – Exploring how artificial intelligence transforms QA
- **UX and QA** – How user experience affects testing strategy
- **Cognitive Biases** – Understanding human factors in testing
- **🛠️ Tools** – Testim, TestGPT, Applitools, etc.
- **📊 Experiments** – My practical notes and outcomes
